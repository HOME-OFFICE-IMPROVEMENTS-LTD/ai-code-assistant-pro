   ```

2. **From Command Palette:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
   - Type "Extensions: Install Extensions"
   - Search for "AI Code Assistant Pro"
   - Click Install

### First Steps

1. **Open AI Chat:**
   ```
   Ctrl+Shift+P → "AI Code Assistant: Open AI Chat"
   ```

2. **Ask Your First Question:**
   ```
   ⚡ Ask Buzzy: "How can I optimize this function?"
   🔨 Ask Builder: "What's the best architecture for this feature?"
   🔍 Ask Scout: "Review this code for potential issues"
   🛡️ Ask Guardian: "Check this code for security vulnerabilities"
   🎨 Ask Spark: "Suggest innovative approaches for this problem"
   ```

3. **Customize Your Experience:**
   - Go to VS Code Settings
   - Search for "AI Code Assistant"
   - Set your preferred default personality

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Code Optimization with Buzzy
```python
# Before: Slow loop
for i in range(len(items)):
    if items[i].active:
        process(items[i])

# After Buzzy's optimization:
# Use list comprehension for better performance
active_items = [item for item in items if item.active]
for item in active_items:
    process(item)
```

### Architecture Guidance with Builder
```javascript
// Builder suggests: "Consider using the Repository pattern"
class UserRepository {
    async findById(id) { /* ... */ }
    async save(user) { /* ... */ }
    async delete(id) { /* ... */ }
}

class UserService {
    constructor(userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
    // Clean separation of concerns
}
```

### Security Review with Guardian
```sql
-- Guardian warns: "Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection"
-- ❌ Vulnerable
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

-- ✅ Secure
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### Innovation with Spark
```python
# Spark suggests: "Try using async/await for better concurrency"
# Traditional approach
def process_data(items):
    results = []
    for item in items:
        result = heavy_computation(item)
        results.append(result)
    return results

# Spark's innovative approach
async def process_data_async(items):
    tasks = [heavy_computation_async(item) for item in items]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```
