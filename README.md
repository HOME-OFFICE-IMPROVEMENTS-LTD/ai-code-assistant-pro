## 💡 Usage Examples

### Code Optimization with Buzzy
```python
# Before: Slow loop
for i in range(len(items)):
    if items[i].active:
        process(items[i])

# After Buzzy's optimization:
# Use list comprehension for better performance
active_items = [item for item in items if item.active]
for item in active_items:
    process(item)
```

### Architecture Guidance with Builder
```javascript
// Builder suggests: "Consider using the Repository pattern"
class UserRepository {
    async findById(id) { /* ... */ }
    async save(user) { /* ... */ }
    async delete(id) { /* ... */ }
}

class UserService {
    constructor(userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
    // Clean separation of concerns
}
```

### Security Review with Guardian
```sql
-- Guardian warns: "Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection"
-- ❌ Vulnerable
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

-- ✅ Secure
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```
