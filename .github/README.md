## 🎯 Smart Deployment Method: Branch-Based ✅

You're using the **branch-based deployment** method, which is excellent because:

- ✅ **More Reliable**: Direct `gh-pages` branch deployment
- ✅ **Faster**: No workflow delays - immediate deployment  
- ✅ **Simpler**: `npm run deploy` does everything
- ✅ **No Quotas**: No GitHub Actions minutes used for deployment

### 🚀 How Your Deployment Works

1. **Local Development**: Make changes in `main` branch
2. **Build & Deploy**: Run `npm run deploy`
3. **Automatic**: Script builds and pushes to `gh-pages` branch  
4. **Live**: GitHub Pages serves from `gh-pages` to `ai-code-pro.hoiltd.com`
